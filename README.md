rsaved
======

A Python 3.6 utility for mirroring personal reddit.com/saved feeds.

## Why?

 - Because reddit won't display more than 1000 posts from your saved feed. Ever.
 - So that it can be searched, filtered, and analysed.
 - So that you can rip content which may one day be deleted.
 - And most importantly, so that it can be searched.
